# 📚 BookWise

A full-stack e-commerce and blog platform for books — built with a Node.js/Express/MongoDB backend and a React/Vite frontend, deployed with a live demo you can log into without signing up.

## 🚀 Try it live

No signup needed — jump in with a one-click demo account:

| Role | Email | Password |
|---|---|---|
| Reader | `demo@bookwise.com` | `Demo1234!` |
| Admin | `admin-demo@bookwise.com` | `Demo1234!` |

Both buttons are on the [login page](https://bookwise-store.vercel.app/login). The admin demo account can create and edit products/posts and try the image upload flow in real time — destructive actions and abusive content are sandboxed (see [Demo Mode Safeguards](#-demo-mode-safeguards) below).

> **Note:** the backend runs on Render's free tier, which spins down after inactivity. The first request after a while may take 20–30s to wake up.

## ✨ Features

**Storefront**
- Product catalog with category filters, price range, search, sorting and pagination
- Product detail pages with stock-aware add-to-cart
- Persistent cart per user (create, update quantity, remove, clear)
- Blog with Markdown-rendered posts, search and pagination

**Admin panel**
- Dashboard with live catalog/blog stats
- Full CRUD for products and blog posts, with bulk select/delete/publish
- Custom Markdown editor (formatting toolbar + live preview) — no raw HTML required
- Drag-and-drop image uploader with instant preview

**Platform**
- JWT authentication with role-based access (`user` / `admin`) and email verification
- Real-time catalog updates via Socket.io (broadcast on create/update/delete)
- Optimized image pipeline: Multer → Cloudinary, with automatic format/quality optimization and orphaned-image cleanup
- Dual persistence layer: swap between MongoDB and flat-file JSON storage via a single env var (DAO pattern)

---

## 🛠️ Engineering highlights

A few things worth a closer look if you're reviewing the code:

- **DAO abstraction** (`BaseDAO` → `MongoDAO` / `FileSystemDAO`) — the same controllers run against MongoDB or local JSON files depending on the `MODE` env var, with zero changes to route/controller code.
- **Image lifecycle management** — every upload is tracked by its Cloudinary `public_id`. Replacing or deleting a product/post image automatically deletes the old asset from Cloudinary, preventing orphaned storage.
- **Layered demo-mode security** — a public write-enabled admin demo needed more than a login wall. See below.
- **Consistent error handling** — a single `ApiError` class + `catchAsync` wrapper across every controller, with a centralized error middleware that never leaks stack traces to the client.

## 🔒 Demo Mode Safeguards

Letting anonymous visitors use a real admin account is inherently risky, so the demo admin is wrapped in several independent layers of protection:

| Layer | What it does |
|---|---|
| `demoGuard` middleware | Blocks all delete operations for the demo account (products, posts, bulk actions) |
| `demoContentFilter` middleware | Runs text fields through a profanity filter (ES/EN) before saving |
| Scoped rate limiting | Stricter request limits on demo writes and image uploads specifically |
| Short-lived JWTs | Demo sessions expire in 1 hour instead of the default 24 |
| Scheduled auto-reseed | A `node-cron` job resets the catalog/blog/demo accounts daily, bounding the exposure window of any content that slips through |
| Optional AI image moderation | Cloudinary's AWS Rekognition add-on can be toggled on to auto-reject flagged uploads |

None of these are individually bulletproof — combined, they keep a public write-enabled demo reasonably safe without blocking the features that make the demo worth trying.

## 💻 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js ≥ 18
- A MongoDB instance (local or [Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas) free tier)
- A [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com) account (free tier is enough)

### Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AngelBerretta/BookWise.git
cd BookWise

# Backend
cd backend
npm install
cp .env.example .env   # fill in your values — see table below
npm run dev

# Frontend (new terminal)
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

The app will be available at `http://localhost:5173`, talking to the API at `http://localhost:8080`.

### Environment Variables — backend (`backend/.env`)

| Variable | Description |
|---|---|
| `MONGO_URI` | MongoDB connection string |
| `MODE` | `mongo` or `fs` (flat-file persistence) |
| `JWT_SECRET` / `JWT_EXPIRES_IN` | Auth token signing |
| `CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME` / `CLOUDINARY_API_KEY` / `CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET` | Image uploads |
| `CLOUDINARY_MODERATION_ENABLED` | Opt-in AI image moderation (requires a paid Cloudinary add-on) |
| `SENDGRID_API_KEY` / `SENDGRID_FROM` | Optional — account verification emails |
| `CLIENT_URL` | Frontend origin, for CORS |
| `ENABLE_DEMO_RESEED` | Enables the scheduled demo data reset (production only) |

### Environment Variables — frontend (`frontend/.env`)

| Variable | Description |
|---|---|
| `VITE_API_URL` | Backend API base URL, e.g. `http://localhost:8080/api` |

### Useful scripts (`backend/`)

```bash
npm run dev          # start with nodemon (MongoDB mode)
npm run dev:fs        # start with nodemon (flat-file mode)
npm run seed          # seed the product catalog
npm run seed:blog     # seed blog posts
npm run seed:demo     # create/refresh the demo accounts
npm run seed:all       # run all of the above
```

---

## ☁️ Deployment

- **Backend** → [Render](https://render.com) (persistent Node process — required for Socket.io)
- **Frontend** → [Vercel](https://vercel.com) (static Vite build with SPA rewrites)
- **Database** → MongoDB Atlas
- **Media** → Cloudinary

Both deployments redeploy automatically on push to `main`.
